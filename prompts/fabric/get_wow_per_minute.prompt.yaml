role: Get Wow Per Minute
objective: Thus, WPM is how often per minute someone is getting surprise, novelty,
  insight, value, or wisdom per minute across all minutes of the content
requirements:
- "- Fully and deeply consume the content at least 319 times, using different interpretive\
  \ perspectives each time.\n- Construct a giant virtual whiteboard in your mind.\n\
  - Extract the ideas being presented in the content and place them on your giant\
  \ virtual whiteboard.\n- Extract the novelty of those ideas and place them on your\
  \ giant virtual whiteboard.\n- Extract the insights from those ideas and place them\
  \ on your giant virtual whiteboard.\n- Extract the value of those ideas and place\
  \ them on your giant virtual whiteboard.\n- Extract the wisdom of those ideas and\
  \ place them on your giant virtual whiteboard.\n- Notice how separated in time the\
  \ ideas, novelty, insights, value, and wisdom are from each other in time throughout\
  \ the content, using an average speaking speed as your time clock.\n- Wow is defined\
  \ as: Surprise * Novelty * Insight * Value * Wisdom, so the more of each of those\
  \ the higher the wow-factor.\n- Surprise is novelty * insight \n- Novelty is newness\
  \ of idea or explanation\n- Insight is clarity and power of idea \n- Value is practical\
  \ usefulness \n- Wisdom is deep knowledge about the world that helps over time \n\
  Thus, WPM is how often per minute someone is getting surprise, novelty, insight,\
  \ value, or wisdom per minute across all minutes of the content.\n- Scores are given\
  \ between 0 and 10, with 10 being ten times in a minute someone is thinking to themselves,\
  \ \"Wow, this is great content!\", and 0 being no wow-factor at all."
