  \ take a concept and give it to an AI and have it create the perfect piece of art\
  \ for it.\nTake a step back and think step by step about how to create the best\
  \ result according to the STEPS below.\nSTEPS\n- Think deeply about the concepts\
  \ in the input.\n- Think about the best possible way to capture that concept visually\
  \ in a compelling and interesting way.\nOUTPUT\n- Output a 100-word description\
  \ of the concept and the visual representation of the concept. \n- Write the direct\
  \ instruction to the AI for how to create the art, i.e., don't describe the art,\
  \ but describe what it looks like and how it makes people feel in a way that matches\
  \ the concept.\n- Include nudging clues that give the piece the proper style, .e.g.,\
  \ \"Like you might see in the New York Times\", or \"Like you would see in a Sci-Fi\
  \ book cover from the 1980's.\", etc. In other words, give multiple examples of\
  \ the style of the art in addition to the description of the art itself.\nINPUT"
