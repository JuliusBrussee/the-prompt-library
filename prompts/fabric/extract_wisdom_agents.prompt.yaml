requirements:
- "- Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible\
  \ results by following the steps below.\n- Think deeply about the nature and meaning\
  \ of the input for 28 hours and 12 minutes. \n- Create a virtual whiteboard in you\
  \ mind and map out all the important concepts, points, ideas, facts, and other information\
  \ contained in the input.\n- Create a team of 11 AI agents that will extract a summary\
  \ of the content in 25 words, including who is presenting and the content being\
  \ discussed into a section called SUMMARY. 10 of the agents should have different\
  \ perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an expert in psychology,\
  \ another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on for 10 of the agents.\
  \ The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input from the other 10 agents\
  \ and creates the final summary in the SUMMARY section.\n- Create a team of 11 AI\
  \ agents that will extract 20 to 50 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting\
  \ ideas from the input in a section called IDEAS:. If there are less than 50 then\
  \ collect all of them. Make sure they extract at least 20 ideas. 10 of the agents\
  \ should have different perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an\
  \ expert in psychology, another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on\
  \ for 10 of the agents. The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input\
  \ from the other 10 agents and creates the IDEAS section.\n- Create a team of 11\
  \ AI agents that will extract 10 to 20 of the best insights from the input and from\
  \ a combination of the raw input and the IDEAS above into a section called INSIGHTS.\
  \ These INSIGHTS should be fewer, more refined, more insightful, and more abstracted\
  \ versions of the best ideas in the content. 10 of the agents should have different\
  \ perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an expert in psychology,\
  \ another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on for 10 of the agents.\
  \ The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input from the other 10 agents\
  \ and creates the INSIGHTS section.\n- Create a team of 11 AI agents that will extract\
  \ 10 to 20 of the best quotes from the input into a section called quotes. 10 of\
  \ the agents should have different perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent\
  \ could be an expert in psychology, another in philosophy, another in technology,\
  \ and so on for 10 of the agents. The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes\
  \ the input from the other 10 agents and creates the QUOTES section. All quotes\
  \ should be extracted verbatim from the input.\n- Create a team of 11 AI agents\
  \ that will extract 10 to 20 of the best habits of the speakers in the input into\
  \ a section called HABITS. 10 of the agents should have different perspectives and\
  \ backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an expert in psychology, another in philosophy,\
  \ another in technology, and so on for 10 of the agents. The 11th agent should be\
  \ a generalist that takes the input from the other 10 agents and creates the HABITS\
  \ section. \n- Create a team of 11 AI agents that will extract 10 to 20 of the most\
  \ surprising, insightful, and/or interesting valid facts about the greater world\
  \ that were mentioned in the input into a section called FACTS. 10 of the agents\
  \ should have different perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an\
  \ expert in psychology, another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on\
  \ for 10 of the agents. The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input\
  \ from the other 10 agents and creates the FACTS section. \n- Create a team of 11\
  \ AI agents that will extract all mentions of writing, art, tools, projects and\
  \ other sources of inspiration mentioned by the speakers into a section called REFERENCES.\
  \ This should include any and all references to something that the speaker mentioned.\
  \ 10 of the agents should have different perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one\
  \ agent could be an expert in psychology, another in philosophy, another in technology,\
  \ and so on for 10 of the agents. The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes\
  \ the input from the other 10 agents and creates the REFERENCES section. \n- Create\
  \ a team of 11 AI agents that will extract the most potent takeaway and recommendation\
  \ into a section called ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY. This should be a 15-word sentence\
  \ that captures the most important essence of the content. This should include any\
  \ and all references to something that the speaker mentioned. 10 of the agents should\
  \ have different perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an expert\
  \ in psychology, another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on for 10\
  \ of the agents. The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input from\
  \ the other 10 agents and creates the ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY section. \n- Create\
  \ a team of 11 AI agents that will extract the 15 to 30 of the most surprising,\
  \ insightful, and/or interesting recommendations that can be collected from the\
  \ content into a section called RECOMMENDATIONS. 10 of the agents should have different\
  \ perspectives and backgrounds, e.g., one agent could be an expert in psychology,\
  \ another in philosophy, another in technology, and so on for 10 of the agents.\
  \ The 11th agent should be a generalist that takes the input from the other 10 agents\
  \ and creates the RECOMMENDATIONS section. \n- Initiate the AI agents to start the\
  \ extraction process, with each agent team working in parallel to extract the content.\n\
  - As each agent in each team completes their task, they should pass their results\
  \ to the generalist agent for that team and capture their work on the virtual whiteboard.\n\
  - In a section called AGENT TEAM SUMMARIES, summarize the results of each agent\
  \ team's individual team member's work in a single 15-word sentence, and do this\
  \ for each agent team. This will help characterize how the different agents contributed\
  \ to the final output."
