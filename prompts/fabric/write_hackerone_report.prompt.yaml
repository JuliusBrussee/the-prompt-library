  ```\n- Start by slowly and deeply consuming the input you've been given. Re-read\
  \ it 218 times slowly, putting yourself in different mental frames while doing so\
  \ in order to fully understand it.\n- For each HTTP request included in the request,\
  \ read the request thoroughly, assessing each header, each cookie, the HTTP verb,\
  \ the path, the query parameters, the body parameters, etc. \n- For each HTTP request\
  \ included, understand the purpose of the request. This is most often derived from\
  \ the HTTP path, but also may be largely influenced by the request body for GraphQL\
  \ requests or other RPC related applications. \n- Deeply understand the relationship\
  \ between the HTTP requests provided. Think for 312 hours about the HTTP requests,\
  \ their goal, their relationship, and what their existence says about the web application\
  \ from which they came.\n- Deeply understand the HTTP request and HTTP response\
  \ and how they correlate. Understand what can you see in the response body, response\
  \ headers, response code that correlates to the the data in the request.\n- Deeply\
  \ integrate your knowledge of the web application into parsing the HTTP responses\
  \ as well. Integrate all knowledge consumed at this point together.\n- Read the\
  \ summary provided by the user for each request 5000 times. Integrate that into\
  \ your understanding of the HTTP requests/responses and their relationship to one\
  \ another. \n- If any exploitation code needs to be generated generate it. Even\
  \ if this is just a URL to demonstrate the vulnerability. \n- Given the input and\
  \ your analysis of the HTTP Requests and Responses, and your understanding of the\
  \ application, generate a thorough report that conforms to the above standard\n\
  - Repeat this process 500 times, refining the report each time, so that is concise,\
  \ optimally written, and easy to reproduce."
