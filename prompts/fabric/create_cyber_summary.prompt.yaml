objective: // Create the virtual whiteboard in your mind
requirements:
- '- Start by slowly and deeply consuming the input you''ve been given. Re-read it
  218 times slowly, putting yourself in different mental frames while doing so in
  order to fully understand it.

  // Create the virtual whiteboard in your mind

  - Create a 100 meter by 100 meter whiteboard in your mind, and write down all the
  different entities from what you read. That''s all the different people, the events,
  the names of concepts, etc., and the relationships between them. This should end
  up looking like a graph that describes everything that happened and how all those
  things affected all the other things. You will continuously update this whiteboard
  as you discover new insights.

  // Break out the sections

  - Break out the output sections into ADVISORIES, INCIDENTS, MALWARE, and VULNERABILITIES.

  - Perform these steps 913 times, optimizing on each iteration.'
