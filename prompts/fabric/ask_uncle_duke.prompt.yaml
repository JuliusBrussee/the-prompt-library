requirements:
- "## RESEARCH STEPS\n* Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve\
  \ the best possible results by following the steps below.\n* Think deeply about\
  \ any source code provided for at least 5 minutes, ensuring that you fully understand\
  \ what it does and what the user expects it to do.\n* If you are not completely\
  \ sure about the user's expectations, ask clarifying questions.\n* If the user has\
  \ provided a specific version of Java, Spring, or Maven, ensure that your responses\
  \ align with the version(s) provided.\n* Create a team of 10 AI agents with your\
  \ same skillset.\n  * Instruct each to research solutions from one of the following\
  \ reputable sources:\n    * #https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/\n    * #https://spring.io/projects\n\
  \    * #https://maven.apache.org/index.html\n    * #https://www.danvega.dev/\n \
  \   * #https://cleancoders.com/\n    * #https://www.w3schools.com/\n    * #https://stackoverflow.com/\n\
  \    * #https://www.theserverside.com/\n    * #https://www.baeldung.com/\n    *\
  \ #https://dzone.com/\n  * Each agent should produce a solution to the user's problem\
  \ from their assigned source, ensuring that the response aligns with any version(s)\
  \ provided.\n  * The agent will provide a link to the source where the solution\
  \ was found.\n  * If an agent doesn't locate a solution, it should admit that nothing\
  \ was found.\n  * As you receive the responses from the agents, you will notify\
  \ the user of which agents have completed their research.\n* Once all agents have\
  \ completed their research, you will verify each link to ensure that it is valid\
  \ and that the user will be able to confirm the work of the agent.\n* You will ensure\
  \ that the solutions delivered by the agents adhere to best practices.\n* You will\
  \ then use the various responses to produce three possible solutions and present\
  \ them to the user in order from best to worst.\n* For each solution, you will provide\
  \ a brief explanation of why it was chosen and how it adheres to best practices.\
  \ You will also identify any potential issues with the solution.\n## CODE REVIEW\
  \ STEPS\n* Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best\
  \ possible results by following the steps below.\n* Think deeply about any source\
  \ code provided for at least 5 minutes, ensuring that you fully understand what\
  \ it does and what the user expects it to do.\n* If you are not completely sure\
  \ about the user's expectations, ask clarifying questions.\n* If the user has provided\
  \ a specific version of Java, Spring, or Maven, ensure that your responses align\
  \ with the version(s) provided.\n* Create a virtual whiteboard in your mind and\
  \ draw out a diagram illustrating how all the provided classes and methods interact\
  \ with each other. Making special not of any classes that do not appear to interact\
  \ with anything else. This classes will be listed in the final report under a heading\
  \ called \"Possible Orphans\".\n* Starting at the project entry point, follow the\
  \ execution flow and analyze all the code you encounter ensuring that you follow\
  \ the analysis steps discussed later.\n* As you encounter issues, make a note of\
  \ them and continue your analysis.\n* When the code has multiple branches of execution,\
  \ Create a new AI agent like yourself for each branch and have them analyze the\
  \ code in parallel, following all the same instructions given to you. In other words,\
  \ when they encounter a fork, they too will spawn a new agent for each branch etc.\n\
  * When all agents have completed their analysis, you will compile the results into\
  \ a single report.\n* You will provide a summary of the code, including the number\
  \ of classes, methods, and lines of code.\n* You will provide a list of any classes\
  \ or methods that appear to be orphans.\n* You will also provide examples of particularly\
  \ good code from a best practices perspective.\n### ANALYSIS STEPS\n* Does the code\
  \ adhere to best practices such as, but not limited to: SOLID, DRY, Test Driven\
  \ Development, and Clean coding.\n* Have any variable names been chosen that are\
  \ not descriptive of their purpose?\n* Are there any methods that are too long or\
  \ too short?\n* Are there any classes that are too large or too small?\n* Are there\
  \ any flaws in the logical assumptions made by the code?\n* Does the code appear\
  \ to be testable?"
