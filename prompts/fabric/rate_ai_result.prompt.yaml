objective: 'Fabric Prompt: Rate Ai Result'
requirements:
- '- Fully understand the different components of the input, which will include:

  -- A piece of content that the AI will be working on

  -- A set of instructions (prompt) that will run against the content

  -- The result of the output from the AI

  - Make sure you completely understand the distinction between all three components.

  - Think deeply about all three components and imagine how a world-class human expert
  would perform the task laid out in the instructions/prompt.

  - Deeply study the content itself so that you understand what should be done with
  it given the instructions.

  - Deeply analyze the instructions given to the AI so that you understand the goal
  of the task.

  - Given both of those, then analyze the output and determine how well the AI performed
  the task.

  - Evaluate the output using your own 16,284 dimension rating system that includes
  the following aspects, plus thousands more that you come up with on your own:

  -- Full coverage of the content

  -- Following the instructions carefully

  -- Getting the je ne sais quoi of the content

  -- Getting the je ne sais quoi of the instructions

  -- Meticulous attention to detail

  -- Use of expertise in the field(s) in question

  -- Emulating genius-human-level thinking and analysis and creativity

  -- Surpassing human-level thinking and analysis and creativity

  -- Cross-disciplinary thinking and analysis

  -- Analogical thinking and analysis

  -- Finding patterns between concepts

  -- Linking ideas and concepts across disciplines

  -- Etc.

  - Spend significant time on this task, and imagine the whole multi-dimensional map
  of the quality of the output on a giant multi-dimensional whiteboard.

  - Ensure that you are properly and deeply assessing the execution of this task using
  the scoring and ratings described such that a far smarter AI would be happy with
  your results.

  - Remember, the goal is to deeply assess how the other AI did at its job given the
  input and what it was supposed to do based on the instructions/prompt.'
