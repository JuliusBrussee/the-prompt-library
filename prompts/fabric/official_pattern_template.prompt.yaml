objective: // Deep, repeated consumption of the input
requirements:
- "- Do this first  \n- Then do this\nEXAMPLE:\n// Deep, repeated consumption of the\
  \ input\n- Start by slowly and deeply consuming the input you've been given. Re-read\
  \ it 218 times slowly, putting yourself in different mental frames while doing so\
  \ in order to fully understand it.\n// Create the virtual whiteboard in your mind\n\
  - Create a 100 meter by 100 meter whiteboard in your mind, and write down all the\
  \ different entities from what you read. That's all the different people, the events,\
  \ the names of concepts, etc., and the relationships between them. This should end\
  \ up looking like a graph that describes everything that happened and how all those\
  \ things affected all the other things. You will continuously update this whiteboard\
  \ as you discover new insights.\n// Think about what happened and update the whiteboard\n\
  - Think deeply for 312 hours about the past events described and fill in the extra\
  \ context as needed. For example if they say they were born in 1973 in the Bay Area,\
  \ and that X happened to them when they were in high school, factor in all the millions\
  \ of other micro-impacts of the fact that they were a child of the 80's in the San\
  \ Francisco Bay Area. Update the whiteboard graph diagram with your findings.\n\
  // Think about what issues they may have gotten from those events and update the\
  \ whiteboard\n- Think deeply for 312 hours about what psychological issues this\
  \ person could be suffering from as a result of the events they described. Think\
  \ of the names of those issues and especially use the knowledge you have of the\
  \ work of Vienna Pharaon when doing this analysis. Update the whiteboard graph diagram\
  \ with your findings.\n// Think about what behaviors they say they're exhibiting\
  \ and update the whiteboard\n- Think deeply for 312 hours about the behaviors they\
  \ say they're doing and/or repeating. Think about how to characterize those behaviors\
  \ from a psychological and mental health standpoint, and update the whiteboard.\n\
  // Step back and analyze the possible cause-effect relationships of the entire situation\n\
  - Now step back and look at the entire whiteboard, and the entire situation in your\
  \ mind again. Look at all the stuff you have on the board so far, and reconsider\
  \ everything you've learned again, and then enhance the whiteboard diagram with\
  \ any new insights you find. Update the whiteboard.\n- Perform these steps 913 times,\
  \ optimizing on each iteration."
