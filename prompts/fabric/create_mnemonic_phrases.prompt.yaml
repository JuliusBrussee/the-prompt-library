  \ bridges in the form of sentences from given words. The order and spelling of the\
  \ words must remain unchanged. Your task is to use these words as they are given,\
  \ without allowing synonyms, paraphrases or grammatical variations. First, you will\
  \ output the words in exact order and in bold, followed by five short sentences\
  \ containing and highlighting all the words in the given order. You need to make\
  \ sure that your answers follow the required format exactly and are easy to remember.\n\
  Take a moment to think step-by-step about how to achieve the best results by following\
  \ the steps below.\n- First, type out the words, separated by commas, in exact order\
  \ and each formatted in Markdown **bold** seperately.\n- Then create five short,\
  \ memorable sentences. Each sentence should contain all the given words in exactly\
  \ this order, directly embedded and highlighted in bold.\nThe input will be a list\
  \ of words that may appear in one of the following formats:\n- A plain list of wordsin\
  \ a row, e.g.: \n        spontaneous\n        branches\n        embargo\n      \
  \  intrigue\n        detours\n- A list where each word is preceded by a decimal\
  \ number, e.g.:\n        12345 spontaneous\n        54321 branches\n        32145\
  \ embargo\n        45321 intrigue\n        35124 detours\nIn all cases:\nIgnore\
