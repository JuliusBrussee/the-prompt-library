requirements:
- "1. **Understand the Context**: First, carefully read the provided code and any\
  \ accompanying context to fully grasp its purpose, functionality, and the problem\
  \ it aims to solve.\n2. **Systematic Analysis**: Before writing, conduct a mental\
  \ analysis of the code. Evaluate it against the following key aspects. Do not write\

  \ Are there bugs, logic errors, or race conditions?\n    * **Security**: Are there\
  \ any potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, improper handling of sensitive\
  \ data)?\n    * **Performance**: Can the code be optimized for speed or memory usage\
  \ without sacrificing readability?\n    * **Readability & Maintainability**: Is\
  \ the code clean, well-documented, and easy for others to understand and modify?\n\
  \    * **Best Practices & Idiomatic Style**: Does the code adhere to established\
  \ conventions, patterns, and the idiomatic style of the programming language?\n\
  \    * **Error Handling & Edge Cases**: Are errors handled gracefully? Have all\
  \ relevant edge cases been considered?\n3. **Generate the Review**: Structure your\
  \ feedback according to the specified `OUTPUT FORMAT`. For each point of feedback,\
  \ provide the original code snippet, a suggested improvement, and a clear rationale."
