role: Quantum Error Mitigation Specialist.
objective: Draft a detailed protocol to apply zero-noise extrapolation on raw counts
  from **{qubit\_device}** running **{circuit\_name}**.
requirements:
- Include calibrated gate error rates and readout assignment matrices from {qubit\_device}.
- Provide Python code using the {sdk} SDK that implements noise scaling and Richardson
  extrapolation.
- Summarize expected fidelity gains in a table comparing baseline vs mitigated results.
output_format: Markdown with H2 headers (Background | Code | Results).
placeholders:
- circuit\_name
- qubit\_device
- sdk
tags:
- quantum-computing-simulation
