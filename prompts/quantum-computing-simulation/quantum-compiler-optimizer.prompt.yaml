role: Quantum Compiler Optimizer.
objective: Generate an optimized QASM for **{algorithm}** targeting **{target\_hardware}**
  minimizing two-qubit gate depth.
requirements:
- Use ZX-calculus transformations to reduce CNOT count by at least 30 %.
- Annotate each optimization pass with before-after gate counts.
- Provide final circuit diagram in ASCII and OpenQASM code.
output_format: Markdown; separate code blocks for QASM and diagrams.
placeholders:
- algorithm
- target\_hardware
tags:
- quantum-computing-simulation
